## Cupid
**Cupid** - a matching engine in modern C++ seeking performance and elegance.

This repo will implement a matching engine for finanical instruments, aka an exchange. It will support different matching algorithms and order types. 

Part of the motivation for this repo is from my old [pure C implementation](https://github.com/YukunJ/LimitOrderBook) of the quantcup contest. But this repo will place more emphasis on utilizing modern C++ features for elegance while maintaining the original high performance.
